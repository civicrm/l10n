"In all cases, the check for an existing matching contact uses the default \"Individual Strict Duplicate Matching Rule\" (match on email address). If you are concerned with existing contact data being over-written by anonymous visitors, you can modify this rule to make matches less likely (or even impossible).\n"
"For example, if you NEVER want anonymous input to match (i.e. always create a new contact record) - edit that rule and set the 'weight threshold' higher than 10. You will then need to run Find Duplicates periodically using a different rule, and merge any duplicate records with their associated memberships, contributions, etc."
msgstr "Em todos os casos, <<the check for>> um contato correspondente existente utiliza a \"Regra Rígida (strict) de Correspondência de Duplicatas para Indivíduos\" padrão (correspondentes no endereço de email). Se você está preocupado com a possibilidade de dados de contatos existentes serem sobrescritos por visitantes anônimos, você pode modificar essa regra para diminuir a possibilidade de correspondências (ou mesmo torná-las impossíveis).\nPor exemplo, se você quer que entradas anônimas NUNCA correspondam a dados existentes (por exemplo, que sempre seja criado um novo registro), edite essa regra e defino o 'limite de peso' como maior que 10. Nesse caso, você terá que executar o Localizar Duplicatas periodicamente usando uma regra diferente, e mesclar todos os registros duplicados com suas filiações, contribuições, etc., associadas."
