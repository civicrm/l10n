build-unified-pots.sh - builds .pot files for the last 3 versions of CiviCRM.

Usage:

- Setup buildkit and make sure that civibuild is in your PATH

- Run this script (where 6.0 is the latest stable version of CiviCRM and 5.75 is the current ESR):
    $ ./bin/build-unified-pots.sh '6.0 5.75' 2>&1 | tee pots.log

- Use diff-check.php to see if the changes make sense. Spot-check new strings
  and make sure few strings were removed (strings may be moved to civicrm-common,
  but there should not be a huge amount of strings removed).

  For example:

  To display strings added or removed:
    $ ./bin/diff-check.php | less

  To display a summary per file:
    $ ./bin/diff-check.php | grep -E '^(\# FILE|Removed|Added|Unchanged)'

  To view a total summary:
    $ ./bin/diff-check.php | grep -E '^(Removed|Added|Unchanged)' | awk '{foo[$1] += $2} END {for (f in foo) {print f, foo[f]}}'

- Push the new strings to Transifex.

NB: We usually build the po files that are compatible for the last 3 versions
of CiviCRM. For example, as of 4.6, this means the po files will be compatible
with CiviCRM 4.6, 4.5 and 4.4.

ALL DONE

Next step is to review the new strings with "git diff".
You are strongly encouraged to use the "patience" algorightm otherwise
the diffs will seem bigger than they actually are:

    $ git status
    $ ./bin/diff-check.php | less
    $ ./bin/diff-check.php | grep -E '^\# .*(removed|added|unchanged)'
    $ ./bin/diff-check.php | grep -E '^\# .*(removed|added|unchanged)' | awk '{foo[$1] += $2} END {for (f in foo) {print f, foo[f]}}'

If it all looks good, commit the changes:

    $ git add po/pot/*
    $ git commit -m "New strings for version 5.xx"
    $ git tag 5.21
    $ git push --tags

After that, you can push the source pot files to Transifex:

    $ tx push -s

If a new component was added to CiviCRM (i.e. you have a new something.pot
that was created), it needs to be added to Transifex. For example:

    $ tx set --auto-local -r civicrm.pcp 'po/<lang>.po' --source-lang en --source-file po/pot/pcp.pot --execute
    $ tx push -s -r civicrm.pcp
    $ tx pull -a -r civicrm.pcp
