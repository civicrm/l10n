Note about language/country ISO codes
=====================================

CiviCRM uses ISO 3166-1 to determine the language/country codes,
such as fr_FR, fr_CA, es_ES, etc.

Initially, Transifex used mainly ISO 639 (fr, es, ...) to codify
languages. It later became possible to use ISO 3166-1.

The recommended method, when possible in Transifex, is to use the
ISO 3166-1 language code, since this is what uses gettext, the
underlying translation tool.

We map ISO 639 to ISO 3166 codes in the .tx/config file.
